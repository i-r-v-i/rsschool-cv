### About Myself:
 I have been studying programming in early 2022. Before this I was engaged in professional music - I played the instrument solo and in a group, conducted the choir and directed the department of additional education at the university that graduated musicians and singers. I published music tutorials and wrote educational programs. Music, which still remains my love, has a lot in common with programming, but the main thing is a keyboard instrument, on which you can create some small and large masterpieces alone and in a team.
 I have completed several projects on native JS and React. I am looking for an opportunity to gain experience working in a team on real projects to develop my knowledge and consolidate my skills.


### Skills and Proficiency:
* HTML5, CSS3, SCSS
* JavaScript
* TypeScript
* Git, GitHub
* React, React Router, Redux
* Webpack


### Code example:
```
DESCRIPTION:
You are to write a function that takes a string as its first parameter. This string will be a string of words.
You are expected to then use the second parameter, which will be an integer, to find the corresponding word in the given string. The first word would be represented by 0.
Once you have the located string you are finally going to multiply by it the third provided parameter, which will also be an integer. You are additionally required to add a hyphen in between each word.

function modifyMultiply (str,loc,num) {
  const arr = str.split(' ');
      const word = arr[loc];
      const v = `${word}-`.repeat(num-1);
      const r = `${v}${word}`;
      return r;
}
